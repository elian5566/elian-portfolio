# Elian Al‑Kadar Portfolio

This repository contains a sleek, single‑page portfolio website for Elian Al‑Kadar.

The site is built as a static HTML file using the Tailwind CSS CDN for styling and a few lines of vanilla JavaScript for filtering the projects section. It showcases sections for the hero, about, skills, experience, projects, and contact.

## Hosting on GitHub Pages

To publish the site:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub and upload the contents of this folder (the `index.html` and any other assets).
2. In your GitHub repository, navigate to **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under **Source**, select the branch you uploaded to (usually `main`) and choose the **root** directory as the publishing source.
4. Save the settings. After a minute, your portfolio will be available at `https://&lt;your-username&gt;.github.io/&lt;repository-name&gt;/`.

Feel free to customize the content, add more projects, or extend the styling to suit your needs.
